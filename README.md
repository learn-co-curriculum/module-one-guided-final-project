# module-one-final-project-directions

Congratulations, you're at the end of module one! You've worked crazy hard to get here and have learned a ton.

For your final project, we'll be building a Command Line database application.

### Goals for the Command Line CRUD App

1. Build at least three models with corresponding tables, including a join table
2. Access a Sqlite3 Database using ActiveRecord
3. Build out a CLI to give your user full CRUD ability for at least one of your resources. For example, build out a command line To-Do list. A user should be able to create a new to-do, see all todos, update a todo item, and delete a todo. Todos can be grouped into categories, so that a to-do has many categories and categories have many to-dos.
4. Use good OO design patterns. You should have separate models for your runner and CLI interface.

## Instructions
1. Fork and clone the module one final project. The person who forked the lab should share the link with their teammates to clone.
